# Heart-Disease-Prediction
In this project, I conducted data analysis on a dataset of 56,000 patients' medical records to explore patterns related to cardiovascular disease diagnosis. I developed several machine learning models from scratch, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and AdaBoost, leveraging the Numpy package for implementation. The models achieved an impressive out-of-sample accuracy of 93%.
To optimize performance, I applied the Early Stopping technique to prevent overfitting and fine-tuned hyperparameters, leading to a 20% improvement in model performance.
